# BT4103 Capstone - Group3

## Introduction
The Multi-lingual Text Classification project aims to leverage deep learning to automate the identification of emotions and stances from texts in different languages, with respect to an entity of interest in the text. The model adopts a double-headed classifier, where each classifier is responsible for predicting emotion or stance. The model leverages a pre-trained language model and is fine-tuned on domain specific dataset.
